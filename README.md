# 🤖 ml-algo-from-scratch

A collection of core machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python.  
This project is designed for learning and practice, and does **not rely on scikit-learn** or other high-level libraries.

## 🛠 Tools

- Python 3.11+
- Visual Studio Code
- NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib (minimal use, for plotting)
- 'csv' module for data loading

## 💡 Motivation

Instead of using `scikit-learn`, this repo demonstrates a low-level understanding of machine learning fundamentals.  
All logic is implemented manually to aid better learning and exploration.
