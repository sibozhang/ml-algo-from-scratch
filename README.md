# 🤖 ml-algo-from-scratch

A collection of core machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python.  
This project is designed for learning and practice, and does **not rely on scikit-learn** or other high-level libraries.

## 📘 Contents

| Algorithm      | Description                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | Classification using distance metrics |
| K-Means Clustering        | Unsupervised clustering from scratch  |
| ... (coming soon)         | Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, etc.     |

## 📁 Structure

- `knn/`: Jupyter Notebook + `.py` implementation of KNN
- `kmeans/`: K-Means clustering demo
- `utils/`: Common helper functions
- `data/`: Sample datasets (if any)

---

## 🛠 Tools

- Python 3.11+
- Visual Studio Code
- Jupyter Notebook (for optional visualization)
- NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib (minimal use, for plotting)

---

## 💡 Motivation

Instead of using `scikit-learn`, this repo demonstrates a low-level understanding of machine learning fundamentals.  
All logic is implemented manually to aid better learning and exploration.
